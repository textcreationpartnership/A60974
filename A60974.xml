            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the READER.</head>
            <p>THis <hi>Comedy</hi> will (I hope) afford more variety both in humor and plot, then to give juſt cauſe to any to believe it a Tranſlation: although (I muſt confeſs) there be a <hi>French</hi> Play which bears this Title; and in Title onely they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble. The <hi>French</hi> are commonly content in their <hi>Comedies</hi> with one ſingle Humor, and Rime; but the Criticks of this Iſland are ſcarce ſatisfied with Reaſon. I expect as many Cenſurers as Readers; but hold my ſelf as little bound to believe them, as to court their approbation: for I ſhall neither live concerned at their frownes, nor much exalted with their ſmiles. Yet am I not ſo conceited of my Work, as ſome of my partiall Friends, who have impoſed upon me the Penance to hear my Play extolled beyond its merit: for my Muſe was never ſo ambitious, to pretend equality with thoſe unparallell'd Poets they prefer her before. However, their Verſes expreſs their friendſhip, and peculiar ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of what you may poſſibly condemn. But I deſire to be tried by my Peers, by legitimate Judges, of which I conceive two ſorts; Poet's <hi>in actu,</hi> and Poets <hi>in potentia,</hi> underſtanders of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: under the laſt notion, I willingly comprehend the generous and accompliſht Gentry of this Nation; not every Mechanick ſtripling that can ſpell his Pſalter, and cenſure Wit over a diſh of Coffee: for a Comedy may looſe halfe its worth by the ill reading, and all its wit through the dull apprehenſion of the peruſer: yet ſuch Readers I may eaſily forgive; for they ſuffer a kinde of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in the Reading, by ſpending ſo much time to ſo little purpoſe, as the condemnation of what they underſtand not.</p>
            <p>I onely contend with the ignorant; to the judicious my Muſe ſubmits, making onely exceptions againſt thoſe, who think a Play criminall which had a Gentleman for its Compoſer; as if VVit and Blood were incompatible.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:48730:3"/>
            <p> Although the yeare of his Majeſties happy Reſtauration gave birth to this Poem, yet becauſe it was not before publiſht, many may wonder why we omit ſo modern and Modiſh a Cuſtome, as the introducing of Songs and Dances in every <hi>Scoene.</hi> Truely, though I hold them decent Ornaments of the Stage, I love not to make them the matter of my Play; nor do I believe them ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to a good <hi>Comedy,</hi> as to intrude them by head and ſhoulders, when they don't belong to my Plot. As neer as I could, I endeavoured to imitate Nature; for I think no impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible accident is here preſented. If to ſome (I meane Poeticall Coblers, Vampers of VVit, who undertake to mend what they can't make) the language appeare beyond the condition of the ſpeaker: their own Reaſon might inſtruct them, that Poets have in all times aſſumed to themſelves a liberty of bettering and exalting Nature; and that Love (of all Paſsions) is the greateſt improvement of Wit and Elocution. Nothing remaines beſides (as I conceive) to carp at, unleſs becauſe it was not Acted on a publick Stage: This Play was brought forth in the Shade, and Glories in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate reception; for ſhe once received the Generall Votes and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of her Auditors: You'll finde by the peruſall what ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves. <hi>Farewell.</hi>
